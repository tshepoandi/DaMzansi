              Located at the entrance to Table Bay, 11 km from Cape Town, this
              island, was discovered by Bartolomeu Dias in 1488 and, for many
              years, it was used by Portuguese navigators, later by English and
              Dutch as a refueling station. Its current name means “seal
              island”, in Dutch.

              In 1654, the settlers of the Dutch Cape Colony placed all of their
              ewes and a few rams on Robben Island, and the men built a large
              shed and a shelter. The isolation offered better protection
              against wild animals than on the mainland. The settlers also
              collected seal skins and boiled oil to supply the needs of the
              settlement. The island was also used as a prison for political
              prisoners, including Nelson Mandela, who spent 18 of his 27 years
              of imprisonment on Robben Island.

              Since the end of the 17th century, Robben Island has been used for
              the incarceration of chiefly political prisoners. The Dutch
              settlers were the first to use Robben Island as a prison. The
              island's first prisoner was probably Autshumato in the mid-17th
              century. Among its early permanent inhabitants were political
              leaders imprisoned from other Dutch colonies, including the Dutch
              East Indies, and the leader of the mutiny on the slave ship
              Meermin
